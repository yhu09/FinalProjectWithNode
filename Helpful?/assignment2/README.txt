Thomas Chang-Davidson
COMP 20
Assignment 2: The Private Car Service

Working correctly:
(in Firefox)
Everything to the best of my knowledge, but limited testing is possible.
Passengers and cars should display correctly but I was only able to test with
weinermobiles as that's all the API gave me when I tested.

(in Chrome)
Slower to load but seems to work.

(in Safari)
Access to geolocation was blocked over insecure connection to
http://localhost:8000. error message. known problem with safari.
